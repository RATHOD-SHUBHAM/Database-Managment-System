# Database-Managment-System

Databases and database systems are an essential component of life in modern society: most of us encounter several activities every day that involve some interaction with a database. For example, if we go to the bank to deposit or withdraw funds. Even purchasing items at a supermarket often automatically updates the database that holds the inventory of grocery items. 



In this project, I have designed and implemented a database for keeping track of information about a DBMS subsystem for managing discretionary access control. 

First I designed an EER schema diagram based upon the SECURITY database requirements and then mapped the EER schema design to a relational database schema. 



Each transaction is been provided with a user-friendly Web-based interface to enter the information needed by the transaction. The biggest challenge was to grant and revoke privileges in real-time. Few constraints have also created hurdles, but building this amazing project has helped me understand the database system and helped me overcome the challenges.



    - Designed & implement Database to keep track of information about a DBMS subsystem for managing discretionary access control. 
    - Designed EER Schema diagram & mapped it to a relational database. 
    - Loaded data into database tables & performed some transactions by providing a user-friendly interface developed using python flask.
    - Access Control Check.
